/*
This file provides you with two options on how to authenticate to
Akamai APIs: either with environment variables or with a .edgerc file.

If you leave both options uncommented, Terraform will error.
*/


/*
- EdgeRC File

In order to use this method you must create a .edgerc file inline with
the information here:

https://techdocs.akamai.com/developer/docs/set-up-authentication-credentials

Once you have done so, comment out the environment variables section
above, and uncomment the settings below.

provider "akamai" {
  edgerc         = var.edgerc_path
  config_section = var.edgerc_section
}



/*

- Environment variables

Option A: Akamai native environment variables

The Akamai provider natively reads the following environment variables
without requiring any provider block arguments.  These always take
precedence over a .edgerc file:

  AKAMAI_ACCESS_TOKEN
  AKAMAI_CLIENT_SECRET
  AKAMAI_CLIENT_TOKEN
  AKAMAI_HOST

If you need to use a named section (e.g. "papi"), use the
AKAMAI_<SECTION>_* prefix (e.g. AKAMAI_PAPI_ACCESS_TOKEN) and add
`config_section = "<section>"` to the provider block. Without that
argument the provider defaults to reading the "default" section, so
the AKAMAI_* (no section prefix) variables are the simplest choice.

Option B: Terraform TF_VAR_* environment variables

In this option we use Terraform variables containing the four key
elements of your Akamai API credential: host, access token, client
token and client secret. There is also support for a fifth option,
account_key, which can be used if you have access to multiple accounts
and your API client has account switching capability.

In order to connect the terraform variables to environment variables,
you need to create environment variables of the format

TF_VAR_<variable>

For example, in order for Terraform to assign the value of
`akamai_host` from an environment variable, create a variable named

TF_VAR_akamai_host

Remember: case-sensitivity applies, even on Windows, so make sure your
environment variables are set up correctly.

> In order to help with local testing, scripts to read an .edgerc file
and populate the relevant environment variables have been provided in
this repo, in the tools/authentication directory.
